In this project for Web Design Class #3 we are to use HTML code to display 100 different emoji's on the screen. We put the code into Javascript by getting the inner html and using a for loop to display 100 emojis dynamically on the page! We also use the css file and code to make the emojis aligned, colorful and more appealling.
